## Usage

### Ansible

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works) is an automation that uses plain SSH connections to configure systems according to a so called playbook.  
A playbook defines a target statefor a system and Ansible takes steps to transform the current state into the desired state.  
Ansible is executed on a so called control node (For example your PC, laptop, workstation, ...) and connects to one or more managed nodes (For example a server, VM, remote PC, ...)

### Preperation

Install Ansible on your control node using the official install guide: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

Prepare your Ansible inventory.  
Ansible usues a so called inventory to know which managed nodes to connect to and apply some settings to hosts.  
A inventory template can be found in `inventory.yaml.example`.
